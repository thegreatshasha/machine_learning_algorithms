## Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository consists of the following.

* Implementations of some machine learning algorithms.
* Solutions to exercises from Bishop's pattern recognition and machine learning.

## How to contribute algorithms
* Create a separate folder inside the algorithms folder, for ex: variational_bayes
* Have a separate latex document for the mathematics part.
* Have a demo jupyter notebook with the code for the algorithm and an example application.

## How to contribute solutions to exercises
* Add the tex file eg: 13.tex
* Have the answers as separate sections.

## TODO currently:
* Implement example of sum product algorithm.
* Implement example of max product algorithm.
* Implement junction tree algorithm.
